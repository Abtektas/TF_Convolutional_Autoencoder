# TF_Convolutional_Autoencoder
Convolutional autoencoder for encoding/decoding RGB images in TensorFlow

This is a sample template adapted from Arash Saber Tehrani's Deep-Convolutional-AutoEncoder https://github.com/arashsaber/Deep-Convolutional-AutoEncoder for 3-channel images. I have tested this implementation on rescaled samples from the CelebA dataset from CUHK http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html to produce reasonably decent results.

Both inputs to the encoder and outputs from the decoder are available for viewing in TensorBoard.
